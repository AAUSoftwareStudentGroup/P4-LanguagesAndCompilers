BNF-syntax:

Arrow or equals sign is "::=" without qoutes

example:
	<ex1mple> ::= <ex2mple> <ex3mple>

Comments are not allowed yet

There should be at least 1 space between each "word"/"command".
	"<name>|<name2>" is not correct, but "<name> | <name2> is

A newline marks a new "command". If this is not desired, use \ as the last character in the line

Or: "|"

Text inserts are denoted using " if more than 1 character and ' if only 1.
No escape characters. If a " is needed, use '"' and vice versa

A tokens name is defined using <name>. < and > will not be included in the datastructure.

Everything is case-sensitive

Groups are defined with '(' and ')'
